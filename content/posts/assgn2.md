## Colour Sorting Machine

#### Context

In this project, we were tasked to solve an everyday problem by utilizing a combination of hardware and software, and develop a physical prototype demonstrating our proof of concept. We were given an Arduino computer and had access to any choice of sensors we desired. Through a grueling process of exploring many different idea, we finally landed on one idea as our top candidate, a colour sorting machine for candy.

#### Sketch Design Phase

- These were the initial sketches of when I was brainstorming ideas for a machine that solves an everyday problem. When I was searching for ideas, I tried to look into the mundane everyday things we do that we can automate or avoid doing altogether.

- Some of my ideas involved the use of smart lights such as the smart light bulb that would reduce blue light levels after sunset.

- Another idea involving the use of lighting was a machine that would illuminate your staircase and any other desired sections of your house during the night. The rationale behind that idea was to avoid altogether a situation where you cannot see where you're going and end up tumbling your way down the staircase at night.

#### Implementation

- In this implementation phase, we utilized the Arduino IDE and C++ to write, compile, and test our code. As shown in the video demonstration, the user would have to place each piece of candy one-by-one, the colour sensor attempts to detect the colour of the candy. Next, it would rotate the delivery system using the servo motor, and drop it into the appropriate bin.
