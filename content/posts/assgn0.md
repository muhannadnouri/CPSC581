## Donald Trump Button

#### Context

Throughout this phase, we initially started out with many different ideas for different people to interview and celebrity specific buttons. As discussions continued and we each shared our sketches and different ideas for a button, the top two candidates were a Batman button and a Donald Trump button. Ultimately, we decided to move forward with the idea of a Donald Trump button.

#### Interview Phase

Donald Trump has achieved meme status with his many infamous statements, rants and tirades. We sketched a lot of the ideas we had in mind with regards certain things such as his promise of a wall, the most recent 2019 US government shutdown, and Twitter feed and composed it into ideas for a button.

Here are some of things that we learnt about Donald Trump:

* He enjoys using his Twitter account as a form of mass communication
* Tweets from his account originating from an Android device were of an angrier nature, and tweets from an iOS device were more calm and well worded.
* The US government was shutdown after  disagreements over allocating a portion of their budget towards a wall promised in his campaign.
* There seems to be speculation regarding the funding of his campaign with receiving support from the Russian government
* Cheeto Trump has achieved meme status on the internet amongst many others
