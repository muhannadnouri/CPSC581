## Batman Button

#### Interview Phase

Throughout this phase I met with Edwin twice to discover aspects of his personality in order to design a button that represents him. Luckily I already knew Edwin from working together for the past year. The following are some character traits that I discovered about Edwin:


* He is a night owl, very sleepy during the day but is up late at night.
* He considers himself both a designer and very technical
* He likes simple but good designs
* Not usually shy but sometimes with new people
* He likes badminton
* He wants to learn Japanese
* His favourite colours are blue and green
* His favourite seasons are winter and fall
* He has huskies and a black cat
* He has an older brother
